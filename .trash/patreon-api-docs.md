# Introduction

## Welcome to the Patreon API!

Get familiar with the Patreon API and tools using the tutorials and references below.

Want more than a reference? For a broader overview and use cases, check our our [developer portal](https://www.patreon.com/portal).

We'd love to hear from you.  

- For fastest technical help, our engineering team and community leaders are active on our forum at [PatreonDevelopers.com](https://www.patreondevelopers.com).
- If you are an organization looking to partner with Patreon you can reach us at [partnerships@patreon.com](mailto:partnerships@patreon.com).
- If you are a third party developer looking to get your app added to our app directory, follow the instructions [here.](https://www.patreon.com/portal/how-to/build-for-creators)

**Public API v1 is no longer maintained and will be deprecated soon.** Please update your integrations to use API v2 and create a new v2 client on the [Clients & API Keys](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients) page. For support, visit the [Patreon Developers Forum](https://www.patreondevelopers.com/).

## Make these docs better

If you find any errors in our docs, we'd love to have you tell us! Share your feedback at [patreondevelopers.com](https://patreondevelopers.com).

We are committed to ensuring continued access to the Patreon API. Existing API functionality will continue to be supported and maintained, and where needed, we will work to achieve and maintain parity with growing data and feature functionality in the Patreon product. Although we will continue to provide select support and ongoing maintenance of the API, we will have limited capacity in the near term to respond to questions through the developer forum. For any questions about how to best access or leverage the Patreon API, please refer to the following resources:

- [Community support](https://www.patreondevelopers.com/)
- [API Documentation](https://docs.patreon.com/)
- [App Directory](https://www.patreon.com/apps)

If you have an inquiry about partnering with Patreon, please contact us at [partnerships@patreon.com](mailto:partnerships@patreon.com).

Make sure to include a User-Agent header in your code that calls the API, otherwise your calls may be dropped with a 403 response. For the value of the User-Agent header, try to use an informative string that can identify your app, in a format like "MyCampaignName - Sync App", or "MyCampaignName - Website".

To be able to get your patrons' Discord user ids via the API, you must connect Patreon's Discord integration at your page at patreon.com and add it as a benefit to the tier(s) for which you will ask the Discord ids from the API. You can use your own Discord bot along Patreon's Discord integration.

# API Libraries

We've written some open source libraries to help you use our platform services. Our API follows the [JSON:API spec](http://jsonapi.org) which is pretty complex and these libraries make it a bit easier to work with.

All of the libraries listed below require that you [register a client application](https://docs.patreon.com/#clients-and-api-keys) and get API keys.

## Python

Get the package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/patreon/), typically via pip:

### Install

`pip install patreon`

or

`echo "patreon" >> requirements.txt   pip install -r requirements.txt`

Make sure that, however you install patreon, you install its dependencies as well

View the source on [github](https://github.com/Patreon/patreon-python)

## PHP

Available on [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/patreon/patreon)

### Install

`composer require patreon/patreon`

View the source on [github](https://github.com/Patreon/patreon-php)

# Third Party Libraries

There are a number of third party libraries that the developer community has created.

## Go

View the source on [github](https://github.com/mxpv/patreon-go)

## django-allauth

Patreon is available as an OAuth backend in [django-allauth](http://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## python-social-auth

Patreon is available as an OAuth backend in [python-social-auth](http://python-social-auth-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Clients and API Keys

In order to authenticate with OAuth and interact with the Patreon API, you'll have to [register your Client(s)](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients). This involves signing up on patreon.com and making a [creator account](https://www.patreon.com/create-on-patreon).

Once you've registered a Client you'll have access to a:

- **Client ID** – Used to identify your application/tool with the client you registered.
- **Client Secret** – Used to authenticate your application/tool with the client you registered.
- **Creator's Access Token** – Which can be used to access the API in the context of the creator you account you made when registering a client.
- **Creator's Refresh Token** – Can be used to refresh new access tokens.

Note: Please never reveal your **Client Secret(s)**. If the secret is compromised, the attacker could get access to your campaign info, all of your patrons' profile info, email addresses, and their pledge amounts. If you fear your secret has been compromised, please let us know, and we will look into granting you a new id/secret pair.

# OAuth

Patreon has an [OAuth](https://oauth.net/) provider service — the technology that lets you log in to Medium with Twitter, log in to Disqus with Google+, and even login to Patreon with Facebook.

Below, you’ll find steps explaining how to begin integrating with us. It assumes understanding in HTTP protocol and OAuth, and that you have administrative access & developer control of the server that you wish to integrate with Patreon.

All API calls must be made **via HTTPS**.

Here are some helpful resources regarding these technologies: [HTTP the Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) and [An Introduction to OAuth 2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2)

Looking to dive in to the [API](https://docs.patreon.com/#api)? You can use your **Creator's Access Token** you get when registering a Client in place of the token you'd get back from the OAuth flow to start exploring the different endpoints or building a single creator application or tool.

## Step 1 - Registering Your Client

To set up OAuth, you will need to register your client application on the [Clients & API Keys](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients) page.

## Step 2 - Making the Log In Button

> Request [2]

```
GET www.patreon.com/oauth2/authorize
    ?response_type=code
    &client_id=<your client id>
    &redirect_uri=<one of your redirect_uris that you provided in step 1>
    &scope=<optional list of requested scopes>
    &state=<optional string>

```

Once your client is registered, you should create a “Log in with Patreon” and/or “Link your Patreon account” button on your site which directs users to the following URL:

### HTTPS Request

`GET www.patreon.com/oauth2/authorize`

### Query Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|response_type **_Required_**|OAuth grant type. Set this to `code`.|
|client_id **_Required_**|Your client id|
|redirect_uri **_Required_**|One of your `redirect_uri`s that you provided in step 1|
|scope|This optional parameter will default to `users pledges-to-me my-campaign`, which fetches user profile information, pledges to your creator, and your creator info. It will be displayed to the user in human-friendly terms when signing in with Patreon. If your client requires the ability to ask for pledges or campaign data of **other users** (not just your own campaign), please contact us in [the developers forum](https://www.patreondevelopers.com/).|
|state|This optional parameter will be transparently appended as a query parameter when redirecting to your `redirect_uri`. This should be used as [CSRF](https://medium.com/@charithra/introduction-to-csrf-a329badfca49), and can be used as session/user identification as well. E.g. `https://www.patreon.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=123&redirect_uri=https://www.mysite.com/custom-uri&state=their_session_id`. On this page, users will be asked if they wish to grant your client access to their account info. When they grant or deny access, **they will be redirected to the provided redirect_uri (so long as it is pre-registered with us)**.|

## Step 3 - Handling OAuth Redirect

> Request [3]

```
GET https://www.mysite.com/custom-uri
    ?code=<single use code>
    &state=<string>
```

When the link in [Step 2](https://docs.patreon.com/#step-2-making-the-log-in-button) redirects to the provided `redirect_uri`, e.g. https://www.mysite.com/custom-uri, it will bring extra HTTPS query parameters as follows (assuming the user granted your client access):

### Query Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|code|Used to fetch access tokens for the session that just signed in with Patreon.|
|state|Transparently appended from the state param you provided in your initial link in Step 2.|

**Note**: Users that have not verified their email address through Patreon will receive an error message that they are required to verify their email address before they can use the OAuth flow. This verification email will be sent automatically to users upon receiving this message.

## Step 4 - Validating Receipt of the OAuth Token

> Request [4]

```
POST www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/token

code=<single use code, as passed in to GET route [2]>
&grant_type=authorization_code
&client_id=<your client id>
&client_secret=<your client secret>
&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>
```

Make sure to also include this header: `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

Your server should handle GET requests in [Step 3](https://docs.patreon.com/#step-3-handling-oauth-redirect) by performing the following request on the server (not as a redirect):

> which will return a JSON response of:

```
{
    "access_token": <single use token>,
    "refresh_token": <single use token>,
    "expires_in": <token lifetime duration>,
    "scope": <token scopes>,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

> to be stored on your server, one pair per user.

Remember! - this step happens on your server. Our [API Libraries](https://docs.patreon.com/#api-libraries) typically handle this step for you or if you want to see examples of this step in other programming languages.

## Step 5 - Using the OAuth Token

You may use the received `access_token` to make [API](https://docs.patreon.com/#api) calls. For example, a typical first usage of the new `access_token` would be to [fetch the user's profile info](https://docs.patreon.com/#fetch-your-own-profile-and-campaign-info), and either merge that into their existing account on your site, or make a new account for them. You could then use their pledge level to show or hide certain parts of your site.

Remember! - this step happens on your server.

## Step 6 - Resolving the OAuth Redirect

To reiterate, requests [4] and [5] should be performed by your server (synchronously or asynchronously) in response to receiving the GET request in request [3].

Once your calls are complete, you will have the user’s profile info and pledge level for your creator.

If requests [4] and [5] were performed synchronously, then you can return a HTTPS 302 for their GET in request [3], redirecting to a page with appropriate success dialogs & profile information. If the requests in requests [4] and [5] are being performed asynchronously, your response to request [3] should probably contain AJAX code that will notify the user once requests [4] and [5] are completed.

## Step 7 - Keeping up to date

> Request [7]

```
POST www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/token

grant_type=refresh_token
&refresh_token=<the user‘s refresh_token>
&client_id=<your client id>
&client_secret=<your client secret>
```

> which will return a JSON response of:

```
{
    "access_token": <single use token>,
    "refresh_token": <single use token>,
    "expires_in": <token lifetime duration>,
    "scope": <token scopes>,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

> and you should store this information just as before.

Tokens are valid for the duration specified by "expires_in" field. During this period, you may refresh a user’s information using the API calls from step 4. If you wish to get up-to-date information after the token has expired, a new token may be issued to be used. To refresh a token, make a POST request to the token endpoint with a grant type of `refresh_token`, as in the example. You may also manually refresh the token on the appropriate client in your [clients page](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients).

# Errors

The Patreon API uses the following error codes:

|Error Code|Meaning|
|---|---|
|400|Bad Request -- Something was wrong with your request (syntax, size too large, etc.)|
|401|Unauthorized -- Authentication failed (bad API key, invalid OAuth token, incorrect scopes, etc.)|
|403|Forbidden -- The requested is hidden for administrators only.|
|404|Not Found -- The specified resource could not be found.|
|405|Method Not Allowed -- You tried to access a resource with an invalid method.|
|406|Not Acceptable -- You requested a format that isn't json.|
|410|Gone -- The resource requested has been removed from our servers.|
|429|Too Many Requests -- Slow down!|
|500|Internal Server Error -- Our server ran into a problem while processing this request. Please try again later.|
|503|Service Unavailable -- We're temporarily offline for maintenance. Please try again later.|

# Rate Limits

To ensure the reliability, security, and performance of our platform, Patreon enforces rate limits on API usage. These limits help protect both our systems and your applications from unintentional misuse or abuse.

## Client and Token Rate Limiting

> Response example for client and token rate limits (HTTP 429)

```
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": null,
      "code_name": "RequestThrottled",
      "detail": "You have made too many attempts. Please try again later.",
      "id": "eb96e70d-909f-40cc-a3dc-e922cc90ea0a",
      "retry_after_seconds": 9,
      "status": "429",
      "title": "You have made too many attempts. Please try again later."
    }
  ]
}
```

API requests are subject to rate limits at both the client and access token levels:

- **Client:** Up to 100 requests every 2 seconds
- **Access Token:** Up to 100 requests per minute

Refreshing an access token does not reset or bypass the rate limits.

If your application exceeds these thresholds, it will receive an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response. Applications should be designed to handle these gracefully, implementing retries with backoff as needed.

Responses for rate limited requests may optionally include the following response object. Treat all attributes in the response as optional. Use the `retry_after_seconds` value to determine when the next request can be made.

## Edge Rate Limiting

> Response example for edge rate limits (HTTP 429)

```
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "detail": "Too many bad requests. Time to cool down.",
      "retry_after_seconds": 1800
    }
  ]
}
```

A higher-level rate limit is enforced when a large number of bad requests (over 2,000 HTTP 4xx responses) are detected within a 10-minute window. Exceeding this threshold will result in a temporary block from the API for 30 minutes.

This is most commonly triggered by repeated:

- **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** (e.g., expired or invalid access tokens)
- **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests** (exceeding standard rate limits)

Rate limits are subject to change, and applications should handle HTTP 429 responses gracefully.

# APIv2: OAuth

### What's new?

At a high level, the main differences between APIv1 and APIv2 are:

1. The Pledges resource has been replaced by the Members resource. Members return more data about the relationship between a patron and a creator, including charge status and membership lifetime.
2. **All data attributes and relationships must be explicitly requested** with the `fields` and `include` [query params](https://docs.patreon.com/#requesting-specific-data). In v1, the server would return certain attributes and relationships by default. Now, in v2, no data other than type and id will be returned for a resource unless it is requested.
3. The scopes have been improved. We have reworked what scopes are available in the API to provide better access for developers and better security for our users.
4. Developers can now create webhooks on campaigns on behalf of the creator, so your application can get real-time updates about a creator's campaign.

### What stays the same?

1. Getting access to a Patreon user’s account via OAuth works much the same. Just make sure to request all required scopes.
2. The client creator’s access token will automatically have all V2 scopes associated with it.
3. We will not be deprecating APIv1 in the next year at least.

### Note to those with V1 tokens:

You will be able to request tokens with any set of APIv2 scopes from your existing APIv1 client. If you choose to create an APIv2-specific client in the developer portal, that client will only be able to request V2 scopes.

## Scopes

|Scope|Description|
|---|---|
|identity|Provides read access to data about the user. See the /identity endpoint documentation for details about what data is available.|
|identity[email]|Provides read access to the user’s email.|
|identity.memberships|Provides read access to the user’s memberships.|
|campaigns|Provides read access to basic campaign data. See the /campaign endpoint documentation for details about what data is available.|
|w:campaigns.webhook|Provides read, write, update, and delete access to the campaign’s webhooks created by the client.|
|campaigns.lives|Allows reading of lives created by the campaign.|
|w:campaigns.lives|Allows creation and updating of lives on behalf of the campaign.|
|campaigns.members|Provides read access to data about a campaign’s members. See the /members endpoint documentation for details about what data is available. Also allows the same information to be sent via webhooks created by your client.|
|campaigns.members[email]|Provides read access to the member’s email. Also allows the same information to be sent via webhooks created by your client.|
|campaigns.members.address|Provides read access to the member’s address, if an address was collected in the pledge flow. Also allows the same information to be sent via webhooks created by your client.|
|campaigns.posts|Provides read access to the posts on a campaign.|

**Note:** During the OAuth2 authorization flow, Patreon currently _appends_ newly requested scopes to any scopes a user has previously approved. Scopes are not overwritten or reduced.

As a result, reauthorizing with a smaller scope set will still grant your client the **union** of all previously approved scopes. This behavior may change in the future, so clients should always request the full set of scopes they require.

## Using APIv2 with APIv1

During the transitionary period, when APIv1 and APIv2 are both available, it is possible to make requests against APIv1 endpoints with APIv2 clients and tokens. APIv2 has more controls around private information, so a fuller set of APIv2 scopes is needed to access V1 resources.

|V1 Scope|V2 Scopes Required|
|---|---|
|campaigns|campaigns|
|my-campaign|campaigns|
|pledges|campaigns.members, campaigns.members[email], campaigns.members.address|
|pledges-to-me|identity.memberships|
|users|identity, identity[email]|

# APIv2: Resource Endpoints

All API requests should use the hostname https://www.patreon.com

With APIv2, all properties must be individually requested; there are no more default properties on resources. This is done by including the desired proprties in the fields parameter i.e.: `fields[address]=addressee,city`

## GET /api/oauth2/v2/identity

Fetches the [User](https://docs.patreon.com/#user-v2) resource.

Top-level `includes`: [`memberships`](https://docs.patreon.com/#member), [`campaign`](https://docs.patreon.com/#campaign-v2).

This is the endpoint for accessing information about the current [User](https://docs.patreon.com/#user-v2) with reference to the oauth token. With the basic scope of identity, you will receive the user’s public profile information. If you have the `identity[email]` scope, you will also get the user’s email address. You will not receive email address without that scope.

Fields for each include must be explicitly requested i.e. `fields[campaign]=summary,is_monthly&fields[user]=full_name,email` but url encode the brackets i.e.`fields%5Bcampaign%5D=summary,is_monthly&fields%5Buser%5D=full_name,email`

```
// Sample response with email scope for (url decoded) https://www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/v2/identity?fields[user]=about,created,email,first_name,full_name,image_url,last_name,social_connections,thumb_url,url,vanity
{
    "data": {
        "attributes": {
            "email": "some_email@email.com",
            "full_name": "Platform Team"
        },
        "id": "id",
        "relationships": {
            "campaign": {
                "data": {
                    "id": "id",
                    "type": "campaign"
                },
                "links": {
                    "related": "https://www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/v2/campaigns/id"
                }
            }
        },
        "type": "user"
    },
    "included": [
        {
            "attributes": {
                "is_monthly": true,
                "summary": "Hi There"
            },
            "id": "id",
            "type": "campaign"
        }
    ],
    "links": {
        "self": "https://www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/v2/user/id"
    }
}
```

You can request related data through includes, ie, `/api/oauth2/v2/identity?include=memberships` and `/api/oauth2/v2/identity?include=campaign`.

- If you request [Campaign](https://docs.patreon.com/#campaign-v2) and have the campaigns scope, you will receive information about the user’s [Campaign](https://docs.patreon.com/#campaign-v2).
- If you request [Campaign](https://docs.patreon.com/#campaign-v2) and memberships, you will receive information about the user’s [memberships](https://docs.patreon.com/#member) and the [Campaign](https://docs.patreon.com/#campaign-v2)s they are [Member](https://docs.patreon.com/#member) of, provided you have the `campaigns` and `identity.memberships` scopes.
- If you request memberships and DON’T have the `identity.memberships` scope, you will receive data about the user’s membership to your campaign. If you DO have the scope, you will receive data about all of the user’s memberships, to all the campaigns they’re members of.

## GET /api/oauth2/v2/campaigns

Requires the `campaigns` scope. Returns a list of [Campaign](https://docs.patreon.com/#campaign-v2)s owned by the authorized user.

Top-level `includes`: [`tiers`](https://docs.patreon.com/#tier), [`creator`](https://docs.patreon.com/#user-v2), [`benefits`](https://docs.patreon.com/#benefit), [`goals`](https://docs.patreon.com/#goal).

Fields for each include must be explicitly requested i.e. `fields[tier]=currently_entitled_tiers` but url encode the brackets i.e.`fields%5Btier%5D=currently_entitled_tiers`

```

## GET /api/oauth2/v2/campaigns/{campaign_id}

Requires the `campaigns` scope. The single resource endpoint returns information about a single [Campaign](https://docs.patreon.com/#campaign-v2), fetched by campaign ID.

Top-level `includes`: [`address`](https://docs.patreon.com/#address) (requires `campaigns.members.address` scope), [`campaign`](https://docs.patreon.com/#campaign-v2), [`currently_entitled_tiers`](https://docs.patreon.com/#tier), [`user`](https://docs.patreon.com/#user-v2), [`pledge_history`](https://docs.patreon.com/#pledge-event).

Fields for each include must be explicitly requested i.e. `fields[tier]=currently_entitled_tiers` but url encode the brackets i.e.`fields%5Btier%5D=currently_entitled_tiers`

|Trigger|Cause|

|members:update|Triggered when the membership information is changed. Includes updates on payment charging events.|
|members:delete|Triggered when a membership is deleted. Note that you may get more than one of these per patron if they delete and renew their membership. Deletion only occurs if no prior payment happened, otherwise pledge deletion is an update to member status.|
|members:pledge:create|Triggered when a new pledge is created for a member. Does not trigger when a user becomes a free member or redeems a gift.|
|members:pledge:update|Triggered when a member updates (upgrade, downgrade) their pledge.|
|members:pledge:delete|Triggered when a member deletes their pledge. Does not trigger when a user cancels a free or gifted membership.|

|posts:update|Triggered when a post is updated on a campaign.|
|posts:delete|Triggered when a post is deleted on a campaign.|

Note: When the webhooks API was made available in a limited beta to API v1 customers, we allowed triggers on the pledge model. In API v2, pledge has been deprecated and member is the resource of record. Any existing webhooks on pledge will continue to work until API v1 is deprecated.

## Webhook Responses

When a webhook fires, the data will look something like this. Note that there will be a `X-Patreon-Signature` header, which is the HEX digest of the message body HMAC signed (with MD5) using your webhook's secret. We suggest you use this to verify authenticity of the webhook event. Webhook secrets should not be shared.

# Migrating from API v1 to API v2

**API v1 is being deprecated.** We strongly recommend migrating all integrations to API v2. Deprecation timeline details will be announced soon.

This guide covers the key differences between API v1 and API v2 to help you plan your migration.

## Overview of Changes

API v2 introduces a redesigned resource model, new OAuth scopes, updated endpoints, and expanded webhook support. It also exposes new product features such as gifted memberships, lives, and free trials. Below is a summary of the main areas affected.

## Endpoint Changes

v2 endpoints live under `/api/oauth2/v2/` instead of `/api/oauth2/api/`.

|v1 Endpoint|v2 Equivalent|
|---|---|
|`/api/oauth2/api/current_user`|`/api/oauth2/v2/identity`|
|`/api/oauth2/api/campaigns/{campaign_id}/pledges`|`/api/oauth2/v2/campaigns/{campaign_id}/members`|

See [APIv2: Resource Endpoints](https://docs.patreon.com/#apiv2-resource-endpoints) for the full list.

## Pledges to Members

The `pledge` resource has been replaced by the `member` resource. Members provide richer data about the patron-creator relationship including:

- `patron_status` — `active_patron`, `declined_patron`, or `former_patron`
- `last_charge_date` and `last_charge_status`
- `campaign_lifetime_support_cents`
- `currently_entitled_amount_cents`

See the [Member resource](https://docs.patreon.com/#member) for the full list of available attributes.

## Explicit Field Requests

In v1, resources return certain attributes by default. In v2, **no attributes are returned unless explicitly requested** using `fields` and `include` query parameters.

For example:

`GET /api/oauth2/v2/campaigns/{campaign_id}/members?fields[member]=full_name,patron_status,email&fields[user]=first_name`

Note: brackets must be URL-encoded (e.g. `fields%5Bmember%5D`).

## OAuth Scope Changes

v2 uses a new set of more granular OAuth scopes. If you are creating a new v2 client, you will need to request the appropriate v2 scopes.

|v1 Scope|v2 Scope(s)|
|---|---|
|`users`|`identity`, `identity[email]`|
|`pledges-to-me`|`identity.memberships`|
|`my-campaign`|`campaigns`|
|`pledges`|`campaigns.members`, `campaigns.members[email]`, `campaigns.members.address`|
|`campaigns`|`campaigns`|

See [APIv2: OAuth](https://docs.patreon.com/#apiv2-oauth) for the full scope reference.

## Webhook Changes

Webhook triggers have been updated to reflect the new resource model.

|v1 Trigger|v2 Trigger(s)|
|---|---|
|`pledge:create`|`members:pledge:create`|
|`pledge:update`|`members:pledge:update`|
|`pledge:delete`|`members:pledge:delete`|

v2 also adds new triggers: `members:create`, `members:update`, `members:delete`, `posts:publish`, `posts:update`, and `posts:delete`.

Webhooks can now be managed programmatically via the [Webhooks API](https://docs.patreon.com/#apiv2-webhook-endpoints).

## New Resources in v2

v2 introduces several new resources:

- **Benefit** — creator-defined benefits attached to tiers
- **Deliverable** — tracks benefit fulfillment for members
- **Tier** — membership levels with associated benefits
- **Address** — patron shipping address data

## Deprecated in v2

- **Goals** resource — always returns empty
- **`is_follower`** field on Member — the follower concept has been replaced by free membership (i.e. users with a membership to the free tier)
- **`vanity`** on User — use `campaign.vanity` instead

## Pagination Changes

v2 uses cursor-based pagination with `page[count]` and `page[cursor]` parameters. The next cursor is returned in `meta.pagination.cursors.next` in the response.

## Getting Started With Migration

1. Create a new v2 client on the [Clients & API Keys](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients) page
2. Update your OAuth scopes to use v2 equivalents
3. Update your API calls to use v2 endpoints and explicitly request fields
4. Update any webhook integrations to use v2 triggers

# APIv1: Resources (deprecated)

Our JSON responses follow the [JSON:API standard](http://jsonapi.org), with the following structure for our three main resources (users, campaigns, and pledges):

When requesting some of these resources in our [API](https://docs.patreon.com/#) they will have sensible defaults for what attributes are included. To request optional attributes, e.g. `like_count` and `comment_count`, specify the `fields` parameter in the URL like `https://www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/api/current_user?fields[user]=like_count,comment_count`. For more information, see the [JSON:API docs](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets).

## User

```

    "goals": [ ...<goal>, <goal>, ... ]
    "pledges": [ ...<pledge>, <pledge>, ... ]
  }
}

```

## Pledge

```
{
  "type": "pledge"
  "id": <string>
  "attributes": {
    "amount_cents": <int> // Amount cents in the currency used by the patron
    "created_at": <date>
    "currency": <string> // Currency code of the pledge event (USD, GBP, EUR etc.)
    "declined_since": <date>
    "patron_pays_fees": <bool>
    "pledge_cap_cents": <int>
    // optional properties
    "total_historical_amount_cents": <int>
    "is_paused": <bool>
    "status": <string> // The status of this pledge (valid, declined, pending, disabled)
    "has_shipping_address": <bool>
  }
  "relationships": {
    "patron": ...<user>...
    "reward": ...<reward>... // Tier associated with this pledge
    "creator": ...<user>...
    "address": ...<address>...
  }
}
```

`amount_cents` is based in the **patron** currency which may be different from the campaign and tier currency.

`declined_since` indicates the date of the most recent payment if it failed, or `null` if the most recent payment succeeded. A pledge with a non-null `declined_since` should be treated as **invalid**.

`total_historical_amount_cents` indicates the lifetime value this patron has paid to the campaign.

# APIv1: Endpoints (deprecated)

**Public API v1 is no longer maintained and will be deprecated soon.** Please update your integrations to use API v2 and create a new v2 client on the [Clients & API Keys](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients) page. For support, visit the [Patreon Developers Forum](https://www.patreondevelopers.com/).

> To use a given `access_token`, send it in the Authorization HTTPS Header as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

The three endpoints below are accessed using an OAuth client `access_token` obtained from the [OAuth](https://docs.patreon.com/#oauth) section. Please go there first if you do not yet have one.

When performing an API request, the information you are allowed is determined by which `access_token` you are using. Please be sure to select your `access_token` appropriately. For example, **if someone has granted your OAuth client access to their profile information, and you try to fetch it using your own Creator's Access Token instead of the one created when they granted your client access, you will instead just get your own profile information.**

During the transition period from APIv1 to APIv2, it is possible to use [v2 scopes on v1 endpoints](https://docs.patreon.com/#using-apiv2-with-apiv1). If you do this, note that you may have more scope than you had in v1, and so the set of data returned will be much greater.

## Fetching a patron's profile info

```
import url from 'url'
import patreonAPI, { oauth as patreonOAuth } from 'patreon'

const CLIENT_ID = null     // Replace with your data
const CLIENT_SECRET = null // Replace with your data
const redirectURL = null   // Replace with your data

const patreonOAuthClient = patreonOAuth(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)

function handleOAuthRedirectRequest(request, response) {
    const oauthGrantCode = url.parse(request.url, true).query.code

    patreonOAuthClient
        .getTokens(oauthGrantCode, redirectURL)
        .then(tokensResponse => {

This endpoint returns a JSON representation of the [user](https://docs.patreon.com/#user) who granted your OAuth client an `access_token`. It is most typically used in the [OAuth "Log in with Patreon flow"](https://www.patreon.com/platform/documentation/oauth) to create or update the patron's account info in your application.

The Patreon JS library uses a data store pattern for storing inflated objects from the returned results of API calls. In some cases, especially if you have been granted the scopes for being a multi-campaign client or are opted-in to some API beta programs, the JS client calling `/current_user` will fetch the current user's campaign, as well as all the patron users connected to that campaign.

This can result in the user store in the JS library having a larger list of users than expected for a call to `/current_user`, but the current user's `user` object will be in that list.

### HTTPS Request

`GET https://www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/api/current_user`

Remember — you must pass the correct `access_token` from the user.

## Fetch a creator profile and campaign info

```
import patreonAPI from 'patreon'

const accessToken = null   // Replace with your creator access token

const patreonAPIClient = patreonAPI(accessToken)
patreonAPIClient('/current_user/campaigns')
    .then(({ store }) => {
        const user = store.findAll('user').map(user => user.serialize())
        console.log('user is', user)
        const campaign = store.findAll('campaign').map(campaign => campaign.serialize())
        console.log('campaign is', campaign)
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.error('error!', err)
        response.end(err)
    })

This endpoint returns a JSON list of [pledges](https://docs.patreon.com/#pledge) to the provided `campaign_id`. They are sorted by the date the pledge was made, and provide relationship references to the **user** who made each respective pledge, as well as the **reward tier** pledged to.

The API response will also contain a `links` field which may be used to fetch the next page of pledges, or go back to the first page.

When you made a creator page to gain API access, behind the scenes a [campaign resource](https://docs.patreon.com/#campaign) was created. You can access this resource as described in [Fetching your own profile and campaign info](https://docs.patreon.com/#fetch-your-own-profile-and-campaign-info) after authenticating via OAuth with your creator account to gain your `campaign_id`.

### HTTPS Request

`GET https://www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/api/campaigns/<campaign_id>/pledges?include=patron.null`

### Paging

Remember — you must pass a valid `access_token`.

You may only fetch your own list of pledges or public pledges. If you would like to create an application which can manage many creator's campaigns, please contact us in [the developers forum](https://www.patreondevelopers.com/).

# More Data, Pagination

## Requesting specific data

Want to retrieve the patrons for your pledges, or the goals for a given campaign?

To retrieve specific attributes or relationships other than the defaults, you can pass `fields` and `include` parameters respectively, each being comma-separated lists of attributes or resources. You can see which attributes or relationships are requestable on a given resource in the [resources](https://docs.patreon.com/#resources) section.

For more information on requesting specific data, the [JSONAPI documentation](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes) may be useful.

### Requesting optional attributes

To fetch an optional property (for example `total_historical_amount_cents` and `is_paused` on `pledge`), use the `fields` query params.

`GET https://www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/api/campaigns/<campaign_id>/pledges?fields[pledge]=total_historical_amount_cents,is_paused`

A common gotcha is forgetting to URL-encode the square brackets. For instance, a raw cURL will only work if you replace `[` with `%5B` and `]` with `%5D`.

### Restricting included resources

By default, fetching or including a resource will follow that resource's relationship tree as well.

- To fetch a resource without any relationships, set `include=null`.
- To include a resource `foo` but not its relationships, set `include=foo.null`.
- You can also extend this to multiple includes, e.g. `include=foo.null,bar.baz.null`.

For a more explicit approach, you may instead set `json-api-use-default-includes=false`, which will limit relationships to only those specifically included.

## Pagination

Many Patreon API endpoints are paginated. Use `page[count]` queryparam to limit how many records are returned per request. Use the `meta.pagination.cursors.next` value from the response to fetch the next page.

### How it works

> First request:

```
curl --request GET \
  --url https://www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/v2/campaigns/$campaign_id/members?page%5Bcount%5D=5 \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"
```

> Example response:

```
{
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "total": 10,
      "cursors": {
        "next": "03:eyJ2IjoxLCJjIjoiNmY2YWMxMGUtYmU2NS00MTc5LWEyODktMzkwZGMxMTFhMTQ1IiwidCI6IiJ9:1V2dmthW5w5REEsle2scJmOm"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Requesting next page:

```
curl --request GET \
  --url https://www.patreon.com/api/oauth2/v2/campaigns/$campaign_id/members?page%5Bcount%5D=5&page%5Bcursor%5D=03:eyj2ijoxlcjjijoinmy2ywmxmgutymu2ns00mtc5lweyodktmzkwzgmxmtfhmtq1iiwidci6iij9:1v2dmthw5w5reesle2scjmom \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"
```

```
{
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "total": 10,
      "cursors": {
        "next": null
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. Request the first page
    - Specify how many records you want with `page[count]` queryparam. For most endpoints the maximum page size is 1000, however this might lower depending on the relationships and data that are being requested.
2. Read the response cursor
    - The response may include a `meta.pagination` object. If `meta.pagination.cursors.next` is present and non-null, use that value as `page[cursor]` in your next request.
3. Stop when there's no next cursor
    - If you're on the last page, `meta.pagination.cursors.next` may be null or omitted.

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|page[count]|Maximum number of results returned|
|page[cursor]|Return results for the cursor provided in a previous response|

A common gotcha is forgetting to URL-encode the square brackets. For instance, a raw cURL will only work if you replace `[` with `%5B` and `]` with `%5D`.

The `links` field of the response body contains URLs of first, prev, next, and last pages if they exist.

Want webhook functionality without the code? Check out our [Zapier](https://docs.patreon.com/#zapier) plugin.

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time updates from our servers. While there will eventually be many events about which you can be notified, we presently only support webhooks that trigger when you get a new patron, or an existing patron edits or deletes their pledge.

By [creating a webhook](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-webhooks), you can specify a URL for us to send an HTTP POST to when one of these events occur. This POST request will contain the relevant data from the user action in JSON format. It will also have headers

`X-Patreon-Event: [trigger]   X-Patreon-Signature: [message signature]`

where the message signature is the HEX digest of the message body HMAC signed (with MD5) using your webhook's `secret` viewable on the [webhooks page](https://www.patreon.com/platform/documentation/webhooks). You can use this to verify us as the sender of the message.

It's important you don't share or expose your webhook secret!

### Triggers

A `trigger` is an event type. You can manage webhooks and triggers in [Patreon Platform Portal](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-webhooks).

The following webhook triggers have been deprecated and aren't supported. Please use [triggers v2](https://docs.patreon.com/#triggers-v2).

|Trigger|Description|
|---|---|
|pledge:create **(deprecated)**|Fires when a user pledges to a creator. This trigger fires even if the charge is declined or fraudulent. The pledge object is still created, even if the user is not a valid patron due to charge status.|
|pledge:update **(deprecated)**|Fires when a user edits their pledge. Notably, the pledge ID will change, because the underlying pledge object is different. The user id should be the primary key to reference.|
|pledge:delete **(deprecated)**|Fires when a user stops pledging or the pledge is cancelled altogether. Does _not_ fire for pledge pausing, as the pledge still exists.|

### Robust Retries

To ensure that you can rely exclusively on webhooks data, we've put measures in place to make sure your server does not miss a single event.

In case of failed delivery, perhaps due to network problems or server outages on your end, **we will store the events and make sure none were lost until your server is back up**. Over time, we’ll try to send them to you and re-try your server. The next successful call to your server will include all the past webhooks that accumulated.

Our retry schedule is approximately as follows:

- 30 seconds after first failure
- 5 minutes later
- 15 minutes later
- 1 hour later
- 3 hours later
- 1 day later
- 1 week later
- Requires manual retry via our website

You can also use our [webhooks page](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-webhooks) to manually send yourself the queued messages.

### Programmatically Adding Webhooks

In addition to manually adding webhooks, you can also create, read, update, delete and list webhooks with our API. If you would like to know more please contact us in [the developers forum](https://www.patreondevelopers.com/).

# External Services

We have an ever expanding set of external services that enable creators to manage and reward patrons in a flexible way.

## Zapier

Zapier is an automation tool that connects your favorite apps, such as Gmail, Slack, MailChimp, and over 750 more. You can use the Patreon Zapier plugin to automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers to build the integration.

It's perfect for many of the use cases that would ordinarily require webhooks and has an ever expanding set of use cases. [https://zapier.com/zapbook/patreon/](https://zapier.com/zapbook/patreon/)

### Use cases

- Track new patrons in Sales Force
- Get notified on slack when a new patron joins or leaves
- Add new patron's contact info to a google sheet
- Sync new patrons with a Mailchimp, Hubspot, ConvertKit, Drip, InfusionSoft, etc.

Our Zapier plugin currently supports pledge activity (adds, updates and deletes). We plan to add more triggers in the future. If you would like to request a trigger, please contact us in [the developers forum](https://www.patreondevelopers.com/).

## Wordpress

We have a wordpress plugin that allows creators to gate content on their wordpress page to patrons only. For more information [check it out](https://www.patreon.com/apps/wordpress).

# FAQs

## Testing

Testing of the API can be done by creating dummy accounts through the website. To test pledging, it can be useful to:

1. Create a Patreon account with creator page and set it to "per post".
2. Create another Patreon account and use it to pledge to the first account's page. A "per post" pledge will not incur any payments as long as it is cancelled before the end of the month.
3. Use the API as needed.

Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer a separate testing/sandbox API.

## Accessibility

Patreon is committed to providing accessible websites to all of our users, and to becoming WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant. See our [accessibility page](https://www.patreon.com/policy/accessibility) for more information.

Patreon encourages developers to follow best practices in designing and building apps that are accessible, and which adhere to the Guidelines established by the [Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/wai).

We sometimes link to other sites and provide features built by our users or by third party developers. These parties are not vendors to Patreon, and are not paid by us for their content. We have no control over the accessibility of the content, features, or apps third parties may build using our API, and we are not responsible for their providing inaccessible tools.
